4A1,The paper adopts the HR value proposition model VPM as a conceptual framework and examines the role of HR along the model’s five dimensions 1 knowledge of external business realities 2 serving the needs of internal and external stakeholders 3 crafting HR practices 4 building HRs and 5 ensuring HR professionalism A total of 59 articles tackling human resource management practices in the AME are identified and critically analyzed along the model’s dimensions A descriptive survey method is used whereby a multiquestion protocol is administered to senior human resource managers of banks across 13 countries in the region The descriptive results from the 85 surveyed HR managers suggest that current HR practices in the AME fall along the dimensions of the VPM Results also show a shared perception concerning the most and least common HR practices in the region and imply that we can start identifying the contours of an AME HR model
4A2,To scale company value rapidly a new company needs to develop value propositions for diverse parties  customers investors partners suppliers employees and other resource owners as well as align these value propositions with its scaling objectives The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between value propositions for a diverse set of parties and efforts from a new company to scale company value rapidly We review the value proposition literature and then examine the relationships between 19 assertions about value propositions as well as six stable topics that best describe the SERS corpus which is comprised of 137 assertions about scaling companies early rapidly and securely Conducting a topic model of eight topics led to six stable topics Fundraise Enable Position Communicate Innovate and Complement We find that of the 19 assertions about value propositions four are connected to Complement four to Innovate one to Position one to Fundraise and one to Communicate A total of eight assertions about value propositions are not connected to any of the six stable topics This paper contributes to our understanding of how a new company scales company value rapidly adding an application of topic modelling to perform smallscale data analysis The findings are expected to be relevant to entrepreneurs and new companies worldwide
4A3,One of the most valuable resources a company owns is the portfolio of value propositions to its diverse external stakeholders such as customers investors and resource owners In this article we fill a gap in the value proposition literature by identifying features that make the value propositions of new companies different from other resources along with factors that make them valuable A value proposition is conceived as being what enables and improves business transactions between a new company and external stakeholders We reason that two features in particular make value propositions of new companies distinct 1 business transactions between a new company and one or more external stakeholders and 2 investments to create and improve a new companys value propositions that enable business transactions We provide a definition of value proposition and postulate that a value proposition will benefit a new company when it 1 strengthens the new companys capabilities to scale 2 increases demand for the new companys products and services and 3 increases the number diversity and rapidity of external investments in the new companys value proposition portfolio
4A4,With an increasing population a growing middle class and increased resource use our current ways of living and doing business are unsustainable Next to the implementation of innovative technology sustainable development based on innovative business models better understating of customer needs and behavioural change are crucial This research aims at combining principles from both sustainable business model innovation and userdriven innovation to develop more successful radical and usercentred sustainable value propositions Sustainable business model innovation entails developing value propositions that create value for multiple stakeholders at the same time including customers shareholders suppliers and partners as well as the environment and society Userdriven innovation allows developing solutions that are meaningful for people and profitable for business by involving potential customers users and/or other stakeholders in an experimental and iterative design process The study adopts a research through design methodology a qualitative research approach that uses design practice to inform research To this end a design project in the framework of the ClimateKIC the largest European partnership addressing the challenge of climate change was investigated As a result this paper proposes a process for sustainable value proposition design which adopts a thorough dynamic and iterative perspective talking to stakeholders thinking about the problem testing the product service that leads to an actual sustainable value proposition and to a superior problemsolution fit In practice managers are provided with an initial methodological framework for mapping and understanding the stakeholders in a broad sense including and especially users identifying their needs and interests and progressively combining them into a more meaningful and enriching value proposition
4A5,The aim of this article is to examine the concept and functioning of value propositions seen through a servicedominant logic SD lens The variety of perspectives used to understand value propositions are examined from unidirectional communication of value to reciprocal promises of value The concept of reciprocal value propositions is examined in the light of SD logics fundamental premises Examples are included to show how reciprocal value propositions can be used to initiate and guide resource integration activities between initiators and participants across a range of stakeholders of the firm Some taken for granted assumptions about market exchange are examined which act as a constraint on innovation in developing reciprocal value propositions and more generally stand in the way of innovative marketing practice We also argue that reciprocal value propositions reveal opportunities for focal firm engagement with suppliers customers and other beneficiaries beyond sale purchase transactions as part of a platform for communicative interaction In summary we position reciprocal value propositions as a communication practice that brings exchange activities relationship development and knowledge renewal closer together
4A6,This study explores the communication of reciprocal value propositions in buyerseller interaction and examines whether each partys value proposition is congruent with the value sought by their respective counterpart Through 31 indepth interviews with customers and salespeople from six professional service organizations it was found that while both parties deliberately articulate value propositions thereby initiating the cocreation process there are some surprising disparities in the value dimensions offered by the salesperson Although the customers value proposition is largely consistent with the value sought by the seller a marked discrepancy was encountered in the reverse case ie between the sellers value proposition and the buyers desired value These findings indicate a significant misalignment between the sellers value proposition and actual cocreative behavior that can impede the subsequent collaboration and resource integration between the two parties which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and potentially even service failure
4A7,Disruptive technologies tend to underperform on attributes that are considered as key attributes of incumbent technologies and require new value propositions to increase mainstream customer appeal Yet how do firms reconfigure their value proposition as a way to overcome the technological inferiority of disruptive technologies This article conceptualizes and empirically investigates the process of value proposition reconfiguration Based on evidence on the commercialization of electric vehicles it explores the tactics firms use to reconfigure value propositions to increase market acceptance from mainstream customers The article develops a framework showing three reconfiguration tactics compensating enhancing and coupling tactics
4A8,Disruptive innovations often struggle to enter the mainstream market especially those that benefit society Innovative business models can help to make inferior technologies attractive and disrupt existing market linkages As value propositions are an integral part of business models they can play a key role in this process This study explores the effect of value proposition design VPD on the customer value of sustainable technologies in the case of vehicletogrid charging The result suggests that VPD can influence the trajectory and customer value of a technology and pave the way for disruptive innovation It suggests to focus on utilitarian or hedonic values in VPD to target the lowend or highend market respectively a mixed approach reduces customer value Hence the study establishes a link between technology value proposition and market disruption The results have important implications for research and practice as they offer an explanatory framework that can help managers in designing value propositions to accelerate the diffusion of sustainable technologies
4A9,Using institutional theory and a business model perspective we develop a framework and use content analysis of company Web sites to examine differences in customer value propositions among a sample of high growth firms paired with two comparison samples of industry representative firms in 18 declining industries in the U nited S tates Our results indicate that high growth firms develop value propositions that differ substantially from industry representative firms In addition high?growth firms communicate their value propositions more clearly and aggressively than do industry representative firms
4A10,The proposed framework sheds light on the fundamental role that value propositions play in service systems Building on servicedominant logic from marketing and structuration theory from sociology the authors theoretically link three service constructs value propositions as invitations from actors to one another to engage in service engagement as alignment of connections and dispositions and service experience as manytomany engagement The proposed framework generates future research directions and theory development regarding the crucial role of value propositions in service systems ultimately it contributes to a deeper understanding of markets that is different than that which is guided by the standard neoclassical economics view of markets
4A11,The rapid development of advanced information and communication technology enables the mainstream trend of manufacturing value propositions towards smart product service system PSS Prospect innovative value propositions IVPs emerge in the context of smart PSS The IVPs analysis plays a critical role in the successful planning and design of smart PSS business model which includes two key steps identification and evaluation However the existing research rarely systematically explore what value propositions can be identified in the emerging field of smart PSS Thus this study conducts a comprehensive IVPs identification through literature review and prioritize these IVPs to provide support for later smart PSS concept design Compared to other evaluation methods the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory DEMATEL presents higher effectiveness to evaluate the interrelationship and importance degree of the identified IVPs Moreover the previous fuzzybased DEMATEL is feasible to handle intrapersonal uncertainty individual linguistic vagueness and the previous roughbased DEMATEL can effectively manipulate the interpersonal uncertainty group preference diversity Nevertheless there are few researches on simultaneous manipulation of the two kinds of uncertainty which may lead to inaccurate evaluation results Therefore this study develops a novel graphicsbased roughfuzzy DEMATEL method for IVPs evaluation The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed evaluation method are illustrated through the application in the smart vehicle service system and the comparisons with several different methods The proposed evaluation model can provide more accurate and informative results because it integrates the merits of fuzzy set in coping with the intrapersonal uncertainty and the strength of rough set in handling interpersonal uncertainty and supports to present decision inconsistency along with the final weights based on a proposed graphicsbased operator
4A12,This article contributes to the ongoing discussion revived by the servicedominant logic thesis on value propositions in service organizations Against a backdrop of understanding value as a pluralistic social construct that takes place across different institutionalized practices of valuation or regimes of value we argue that value propositions transcend the immediate localness of both value in exchange and value in use Correspondingly we claim that service practitioners may draw advantages from engaging with a politics of value that addresses multiple regimes of value whether commensurable or not A case study of waste management services in Sweden serves as an illustration of such a politics that combines practical economic political and environmental aspects of value propositions
4A13,The success of internal corporate ventures ICVs is contingent upon their ability to 1 anticipate the bases on which their offerings appeal to their target markets 2 adjust these value propositions as the venture develops and 3 leverage their parent corporations relevant knowledge stocks Aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the process requirements of successful exploratory initiatives we build and test a model of venture performance using data from 145 ICVs We find that value proposition evolution is related to venture performance in a curvilinear manner ICVs whose value propositions exhibit moderate evolution perform better than ICVs whose value propositions exhibit no evolution or extensive evolution Furthermore the value proposition evolution performance relationship is moderated by the parent corporations familiarity with the ventures target market
4A14,Health service managers and industry face significant challenges in implementing Hand delivering innovations for healthcare shrinking budgets mean there is a need to understand more clearly the value of innovations An articulation of the value proposition that is the value created for users by technology is the key starting point for current thinking on open and innovative business models The aim of this research is to develop a framework for valuing a new medical device at the concept stage that balances benefit to the healthcare provider against commercial costs This paper proposes that appropriate evidencegathering activities such as determination of the clinical value proposition and early health economic tools such as the headroom method can be utilised as part of the development process to contribute to the early stage estimates of value beneficial to both the health service and industry decision makers
