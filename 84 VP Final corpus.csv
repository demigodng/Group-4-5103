4A1,The paper adopts the HR value proposition model VPM as a conceptual framework and examines the role of HR along the models five dimensions knowledge of external business realities serving the needs of internal and external stakeholders crafting HR practices building HRs and ensuring HR professionalism A total of 59 articles tackling human resource management practices in the AME are identified and critically analyzed along the models dimensions A descriptive survey method is used whereby a multiquestion protocol is administered to senior human resource managers of banks across countries in the region The descriptive results from the surveyed HR managers suggest that current HR practices in the AME fall along the dimensions of the VPM Results also show a shared perception concerning the most and least common HR practices in the region and imply that we can start identifying the contours of an AME HR model
A2,To scale company value rapidly a new company needs to develop value propositions for diverse parties customers investors partners suppliers employees and other resource owners as well as align these value propositions with its scaling objectives The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between value propositions for a diverse set of parties and efforts from a new company to scale company value rapidly We review the value proposition literature and then examine the relationships between assertions about value propositions as well as six stable topics that best describe the SERS corpus which is comprised of assertions about scaling companies early rapidly and securely Conducting a topic model of eight topics led to six stable topics Fundraise Enable Position Communicate Innovate and Complement We find that of the assertions about value propositions four are connected to Complement four to Innovate one to Position one to Fundraise and one to Communicate A total of eight assertions about value propositions are not connected to any of the six stable topics This paper contributes to our understanding of how a new company scales company value rapidly adding an application of topic modelling to perform smallscale data analysis The findings are expected to be relevant to entrepreneurs and new companies worldwide
A3,One of the most valuable resources a company owns is the portfolio of value propositions to its diverse external stakeholders such as customers investors and resource owners In this article we fill a gap in the value proposition literature by identifying features that make the value propositions of new companies different from other resources along with factors that make them valuable A value proposition is conceived as being what enables and improves business transactions between a new company and external stakeholders We reason that two features in particular make value propositions of new companies distinct business transactions between a new company and one or more external stakeholders and investments to create and improve a new companys value propositions that enable business transactions We provide a definition of value proposition and postulate that a value proposition will benefit a new company when it strengthens the new companys capabilities to scale increases demand for the new companys products and services and 3 increases the number diversity and rapidity of external investments in the new companys value proposition portfolio
A4,With an increasing population a growing middle class and increased resource use our current ways of living and doing business are unsustainable Next to the implementation of innovative technology sustainable development based on innovative business models better understating of customer needs and behavioural change are crucial This research aims at combining principles from both sustainable business model innovation and userdriven innovation to develop more successful radical and usercentred sustainable value propositions Sustainable business model innovation entails developing value propositions that create value for multiple stakeholders at the same time including customers shareholders suppliers and partners as well as the environment and society Userdriven innovation allows developing solutions that are meaningful for people and profitable for business by involving potential customers users and or other stakeholders in an experimental and iterative design process The study adopts a research through design methodology a qualitative research approach that uses design practice to inform research To this end a design project in the framework of the ClimateKIC the largest European partnership addressing the challenge of climate change was investigated As a result this paper proposes a process for sustainable value proposition design which adopts a thorough dynamic and iterative perspective talking to stakeholders thinking about the problem testing the product service that leads to an actual sustainable value proposition and to a superior problemsolution fit In practice managers are provided with an initial methodological framework for mapping and understanding the stakeholders in a broad sense including and especially users identifying their needs and interests and progressively combining them into a more meaningful and enriching value proposition
A5,The aim of this article is to examine the concept and functioning of value propositions seen through a servicedominant logic SD lens The variety of perspectives used to understand value propositions are examined from unidirectional communication of value to reciprocal promises of value The concept of reciprocal value propositions is examined in the light of SD logics fundamental premises Examples are included to show how reciprocal value propositions can be used to initiate and guide resource integration activities between initiators and participants across a range of stakeholders of the firm Some taken for granted assumptions about market exchange are examined which act as a constraint on innovation in developing reciprocal value propositions and more generally stand in the way of innovative marketing practice We also argue that reciprocal value propositions reveal opportunities for focal firm engagement with suppliers customers and other beneficiaries beyond sale purchase transactions as part of a platform for communicative interaction In summary we position reciprocal value propositions as a communication practice that brings exchange activities relationship development and knowledge renewal closer together
A6,This study explores the communication of reciprocal value propositions in buyerseller interaction and examines whether each partys value proposition is congruent with the value sought by their respective counterpart Through 31 indepth interviews with customers and salespeople from six professional service organizations it was found that while both parties deliberately articulate value propositions thereby initiating the cocreation process there are some surprising disparities in the value dimensions offered by the salesperson Although the customers value proposition is largely consistent with the value sought by the seller a marked discrepancy was encountered in the reverse case ie between the sellers value proposition and the buyers desired value These findings indicate a significant misalignment between the sellers value proposition and actual cocreative behavior that can impede the subsequent collaboration and resource integration between the two parties which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and potentially even service failure
A7,Disruptive technologies tend to underperform on attributes that are considered as key attributes of incumbent technologies and require new value propositions to increase mainstream customer appeal Yet how do firms reconfigure their value proposition as a way to overcome the technological inferiority of disruptive technologies This article conceptualizes and empirically investigates the process of value proposition reconfiguration Based on evidence on the commercialization of electric vehicles it explores the tactics firms use to reconfigure value propositions to increase market acceptance from mainstream customers The article develops a framework showing three reconfiguration tactics compensating enhancing and coupling tactics
A8,Disruptive innovations often struggle to enter the mainstream market especially those that benefit society Innovative business models can help to make inferior technologies attractive and disrupt existing market linkages As value propositions are an integral part of business models they can play a key role in this process This study explores the effect of value proposition design VPD on the customer value of sustainable technologies in the case of vehicletogrid charging The result suggests that VPD can influence the trajectory and customer value of a technology and pave the way for disruptive innovation It suggests to focus on utilitarian or hedonic values in VPD to target the lowend or highend market respectively a mixed approach reduces customer value Hence the study establishes a link between technology value proposition and market disruption The results have important implications for research and practice as they offer an explanatory framework that can help managers in designing value propositions to accelerate the diffusion of sustainable technologies
A9,Using institutional theory and a business model perspective we develop a framework and use content analysis of company Web sites to examine differences in customer value propositions among a sample of high growth firms paired with two comparison samples of industry representative firms in 18 declining industries in the U nited S tates Our results indicate that high growth firms develop value propositions that differ substantially from industry representative firms In addition high?growth firms communicate their value propositions more clearly and aggressively than do industry representative firms
A10,The proposed framework sheds light on the fundamental role that value propositions play in service systems Building on servicedominant logic from marketing and structuration theory from sociology the authors theoretically link three service constructs value propositions as invitations from actors to one another to engage in service engagement as alignment of connections and dispositions and service experience as manytomany engagement The proposed framework generates future research directions and theory development regarding the crucial role of value propositions in service systems ultimately it contributes to a deeper understanding of markets that is different than that which is guided by the standard neoclassical economics view of markets
A11,The rapid development of advanced information and communication technology enables the mainstream trend of manufacturing value propositions towards smart product service system PSS Prospect innovative value propositions IVPs emerge in the context of smart PSS The IVPs analysis plays a critical role in the successful planning and design of smart PSS business model which includes two key steps identification and evaluation However the existing research rarely systematically explore what value propositions can be identified in the emerging field of smart PSS Thus this study conducts a comprehensive IVPs identification through literature review and prioritize these IVPs to provide support for later smart PSS concept design Compared to other evaluation methods the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory DEMATEL presents higher effectiveness to evaluate the interrelationship and importance degree of the identified IVPs Moreover the previous fuzzybased DEMATEL is feasible to handle intrapersonal uncertainty individual linguistic vagueness and the previous roughbased DEMATEL can effectively manipulate the interpersonal uncertainty group preference diversity Nevertheless there are few researches on simultaneous manipulation of the two kinds of uncertainty which may lead to inaccurate evaluation results Therefore this study develops a novel graphicsbased roughfuzzy DEMATEL method for IVPs evaluation The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed evaluation method are illustrated through the application in the smart vehicle service system and the comparisons with several different methods The proposed evaluation model can provide more accurate and informative results because it integrates the merits of fuzzy set in coping with the intrapersonal uncertainty and the strength of rough set in handling interpersonal uncertainty and supports to present decision inconsistency along with the final weights based on a proposed graphics based operator
A12,This article contributes to the ongoing discussion revived by the servicedominant logic thesis on value propositions in service organizations Against a backdrop of understanding value as a pluralistic social construct that takes place across different institutionalized practices of valuation or regimes of value we argue that value propositions transcend the immediate localness of both value in exchange and value in use Correspondingly we claim that service practitioners may draw advantages from engaging with a politics of value that addresses multiple regimes of value whether commensurable or not A case study of waste management services in Sweden serves as an illustration of such a politics that combines practical economic political and environmental aspects of value propositions
A13,The success of internal corporate ventures ICVs is contingent upon their ability to anticipate the bases on which their offerings appeal to their target markets adjust these value propositions as the venture develops and leverage their parent corporations relevant knowledge stocks Aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the process requirements of successful exploratory initiatives we build and test a model of venture performance using data from 145 ICVs We find that value proposition evolution is related to venture performance in a curvilinear manner ICVs whose value propositions exhibit moderate evolution perform better than ICVs whose value propositions exhibit no evolution or extensive evolution Furthermore the value proposition evolution performance relationship is moderated by the parent corporations familiarity with the ventures target market
A14,Health service managers and industry face significant challenges in implementing Hand delivering innovations for healthcare shrinking budgets mean there is a need to understand more clearly the value of innovations An articulation of the value proposition that is the value created for users by technology is the key starting point for current thinking on open and innovative business models The aim of this research is to develop a framework for valuing a new medical device at the concept stage that balances benefit to the healthcare provider against commercial costs This paper proposes that appropriate evidencegathering activities such as determination of the clinical value proposition and early health economic tools such as the headroom method can be utilised as part of the development process to contribute to the early stage estimates of value beneficial to both the health service and industry decision makers

A21,To support the development and design of value propositions this paper designs the VdiP developer as a framework for the systematic development of digitization enabled value propositions in service systems It considers the advancement of existing likewise the development of new value propositions In particular the VdiP developer highlights the roles of digital technology in service systems and establishes a framework to consider both digital technology and service systems in the development of value propositions
A22,This study examines the state of communicating the brand value proposition via a systematic literature review from research published in marketing journals The paper concludes with a suggestion for more robust empirical research on the construction and deconstruction of brand value propositions a need for more managerially focused research and a future research that examines the under researched area of how value propositions are effectively communicated on branded websites
A23,The purpose of this paper is to explore what value dimensions and related value components are highlighted in the value proposition of knowledge intensive business services KIBS both at the relationship and project levels how value propositions can differ between new and established customer relationships and finally what is characteristic to the evolution of value proposition in the KIBS context The aim is to offer a comprehensive picture of the variety of value components in KIBS relationships likewise how the nature and composition of value proposition changes as a relationship evolves from conducting a single project toward a more established customer relationship Individual experts seem to possess a crucial role in that development
A24,This study aims at contextualizing value propositions by investigating theoretically how consumers experience and evaluate value propositions in practices It pinpoints what their essence is in customers lives the ability of offerings to help customers to enact desirable cultural discourses into experience in practices Hence the study constructs value propositions as firms proposals that integrate sign value the meanings of value propositions addressing desirable cultural discourses experience value sign value materialized into experience in a practice exchange value financial and non financial sacrifices and resources needed to address and materialize sign value In general this study extends understanding on the socio cultural and situational character of value propositions value creation and value co creation
A25,This article provides entrepreneurs with guidance to help understand and express the specific and compelling value proposition for their Internet of Things offer IoT enables such a wide range of possible short and long term opportunities that IoT entrepreneurs may fall into the trap of considering IoT generally rather than positioning their offer to a buyer in a specific manner that helps win deals
A26,The paper pursues to answer this question from the perspectives of data ownership and key value propositions From the dimension of data ownership and key value propositions this research proposes a research framework to guide the analyses of digital transformation strategy The four firms are used to identify five types of digital strategies namely new product strategy new value added service strategy customized strategy product embedded in the platform and platform service product strategy based on the framework of digital transformation strategy decision
A27,Authors draw on the concept of value proposition from the business and public administration literature and use extensive network data from a food systems planning network to test hypotheses focusing on the positionality of member organizations within specific operational subnetworks by correlating positionality with multiple assessments of value Results indicate that embeddedness in the information sharing subnetwork most strongly correlates with member value proposition

A29,This paper aims to examine the notion of value propositions promises of reciprocal value between service providers and their customers valueinexchange and valueinuse all within the conceptual context of servicedominant SD logicResponding to calls in the recent literature for an academic critique of SD logic and its application in marketing situations of varying complexity the paper presents a conceptual analysis of the determinants of value emphasis in value propositions from the SD perspective Four guiding principles are derived from a rigorous analysis of the B29:B42relevant literaturesWays are discussed in which firms might achieve greater flexibility in designing their market offerings and thus manage different customer segments using different value propositions The general conclusion is that the ability to communicate a firms value propositions strategically and effectively is a new area for the development of competence at the core of competitive advantage The findings pave the way for empirical research into the dynamics of value propositions Since the main focus of the conceptual framework is on the customerprovider dyad future studies should broaden coverage to multilateral settings and networked environments Factors that determine the relative emphasis in value propositions between valueinexchange and valueinuse are discussed and the management implications derived from each of the four principles identified The paper elaborates the application of SD logic in marketing by investigating the determinants of relative emphasis of value propositions
A30,"Productservice systems PSS have received attention as having the potential to meet customers needs 
by combining products and services decrease environmental impacts and provide business opportunities 
for industry PSS have the potential to facilitate sustainable production and consumption and 
support a transition towards a circular economy CE The environmental sustainability is often highlighted 
as a driver for and a result of PSS However the social dimension and the shared value created by 
PSS have not yet achieved the same attention A framework for sustainable value propositions 
in PSS is developed with the aim to map and understand the potential sustainable value proposition 
based on the three core elements of PSS product service and system and by investigating the 
economic environmental and social value proposition and the type of interaction required for each 
dimension The framework thus provides insight into the enlargement of value when focus shifts from 
product to service to system The proposed framework is exemplified by a case study of school furniture 
and learning environments in Denmark where the experiences highlight that an understanding of value 
proposition in a system perspective provides a broader recognition of value for multiple stakeholders In 
a product perspective for school furniture the sustainable value proposition entails price and investment 
comfort and design and narrowing resource loops In a service perspective the sustainable value 
proposition entails a focus on reducing total cost of ownership service employment and slowing 
resource loops Lastly a system perspective entails a sustainable value proposition of solutions to societal problems through innovative design and economic savings via rental agreements better work environment and improved learning outcome and closing resource loops The type of interaction changes 
from transactional to partnerships when moving from a product to a system focus"
A31,"It is easy for businesses to underestimate the importance of strategically using VPs They must be 
communicated credibly and vividly a challenge often pursued with great energy by marketing But often equally important and sometimes most crucial of all a business must take its VP serious enough to ensure actually providing it as well"
A32,This research examines whether explicitly communicating the customers resource integrating role in value propositions improves or diminishes value proposition effectiveness Three effectiveness criteria are used role clarity expected customer value and purchase intentionTwo experiments manipulating the presence of the customers resource integrating role in value propositions test the conceptual model in both an indirect interaction and a direct interaction context Explicitly communicating the customers resource integrating role in value propositions increases customers role clarity which in turn influences customers attitude toward the service and purchase intention through a servicerelated ie expected benefits and expected efforts and an adrelated ie ad credibility and attitude toward the ad route However these results only hold for customers high in resource availability This research provides initial empirical support for the oftenstated claim that value propositions should include the potential value of the offering as well as the resource integrating role of the customer Taking a broader perspective this research provides initial empirical support for recent calls to develop marketing communication practices that facilitate valueinuse This papers findings show that adopting a service logic in marketing communications seems to improve value propositions effectiveness
A33,Customer value creation is dependent on a firms capacity to fulfil its brand promises and value propositions The paper explores FLEs motivation to align with a firms value propositions as operationalised brand promises A longitudinal threephase case study was conducted on a businesstobusiness company in the building and technical trade sector This study reveals factors that foster and weaken employees motivation to align with a firms brand promises and value propositions The findings show that coactivity and authentic practicedriven promises and value propositions foster FLEs motivation to uphold brand promises and value propositions whereas an objectifying stance and power struggle weaken their motivation The study indicates that a bottomup approach to strategising is needed and that FLE is to be engaged in traditional managerial domains such as in developing value propositions By creating space and agency for FLE in the strategising process their motivation to align with value propositions is fostered Four motivational modes are suggested to support bottomup strategisingDeveloping value propositions traditionally falls within the domain of management strategising while employees are ascribed the role of enactment Contrary to the established norm this paper highlights employees active role in strategising and developing value propositions
A34,the concept of value proposition was decomposed into five components performance ease of use reliability flexibility and affectivity PERFA The research did not focus on the relationships between the value proposition elements and their relevance in different contexts such as product industry or customer life cycleManagers should support their decision to innovate the value proposition based on customers perceived value The findings provide guidance to managers on how to uncover innovative value propositions and potentially create new demand in an uncontested market spaceThe paper is an original attempt to correlate value proposition and innovation It provides researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the structure of a value proposition and how innovation can influence it

A36,With a focus on supply chains as ecosystems of service exchange our paper aims to explore how value propositions are developed and evolve via combinations of service innovation A single longitudinal case study is presented The units of analysis are different projects along a logistics service provider LSP s innovation journey The study explores how the case company identified innovation in logistics as a gap and developed a distributed manufacturing strategy with a unique business model involving a reallocation of production functions across a global supply network Our contribution is twofold In terms of theory we adopt a servicedominant logic perspective to investigate how companies value propositions evolve over time In terms of managerial contributions our paper provides insights into how service providers can strategically integrate their resources with service ecosystem partners to provide competitive business propositions
A37,"There are many innovations that stem from technological pushes and research and development efforts The commercial success of these innovations is contingent upon existence of a good fit between the technological innovation and the accompanying business model To date this fit has been mostly sought through trials and 
errors In this paper we develop a framework for analytically choosing and aligning two important components of the business model value proposition and target market to fit the technological innovations"
A38,"The circular economy CE can be a driver for sustainability and CE can be promoted and supported by 
the creation of new and innovative business models which embed CE principles into their value propositions throughout the value chains This study focuses on the environmental value propositions of the CE business models The term environmental value proposition refers here to an absolute value being a promise of environmental improvement which a company provides to the environment by its impacts throughout the whole value chain The aim of this study is to outline a framework for evaluating the environmental value propositions of CE business models The framework consists of an environmental value propositions table EVPT and a stepbystep approach towards an evaluation process The framework was tested in three CE business model cases The outlined framework enables a better understanding of circular economy principles combining them with the environmental value proposition With the framework companies can plan and design new CE business models or they can verify intended environmental benefits and analyse their contribution to sustainability The biggest challenges when 
applying the framework were related to the estimation of environmental benefits gained from the 
environmental value propositions at the system level"
A39,This research proposes a new framework on value creation the value matrix The value matrix through its six value propositions provides a comprehensive framework to understand how different organisations within a supply chain create value It explores value creation from both the organisational and customer perspectives A constructive research approach through an indepth case study on the fashion industry demonstrates that the value propositions of key members of the supply chain should be aligned to enhance the value proposition of the entire supply chain and other members which are not strategic members of the supply chain can have different value propositions

A41,From the alignment perspective to develop a comprehensive process model that depicts the important underlying characteristics of focal firmkey accounts dyadic relationshipsOn the other hand crossdyad analysis helped us identify idiosyncratic KAM treatment among heterogeneous key accounts Drawing upon the literature and the field data this study reveals four different patterns of alignment ie opportunistic alignment passive alignment mutualistic alignment and compensatory alignment that may be enacted in accordance with the different relationships developed with the individual key accounts Across the four focal firm key account dyads this study further uncovers how various factors ie idiosyncratic investment power structures behavioral norms and commitment precipitate different alignment patterns and drive alignment transitions over time This article suggests that a focal firm should manage its key accounts by aligning its value proposition with the specific desired value of each individual account and adjust its management approach based on different phases of dyadic relationship development This article extends knowledge of KAM by concurrently addressing its dyadic and heterogeneous nature in a process model The alignmentoriented view of KAM sheds light on the underlying characteristics of focal firmkey accounts relationships and contributes to our understanding of managing key account portfolios throughout the process of relationship development
A42,B2B firms that explicitly emphasize a CVP invest more in their brands have higher future sales and sales per customer We also find that CVP has a negative effect on the size of their customer base perhaps because firms who care about a CVP appear to attract more longterm loyal customers Firms that pay more attention to CVP also tend to spend less on advertising and promotion Future performance particularly among small to midsize firms is positively affected when these firms emphasize CVP and this also holds especially in less competitive markets
A43,The study aims to relate the customer value proposition offered by a bank with its structure of ownership The study adopted a combination of exploratory and descriptive approaches The attitudes and opinions of bank customers were gauged through a survey Based on existing literature a pool of survey items was identified to measure the construct of value proposition It was hypothesized that different types of banks in India are chosen for different customer benefits offered by them The relationship between value proposition and its constituent variablesfunctional emotional and self expressive benefits was analyzed using multiple regression The results prove that while self expressive benefits drive the choice of foreign banks functional benefits are important for all types of banks The research intends to study only the perceptions of customers having an account in Indian public sector banks private sector banks or foreign banks The study helps to relate the type of bank a customer chooses with the value proposition it offers Using this study banks can configure the value proposition that is appropriate for their target segments The paper examines the value proposition offered by the three different types of banks empirically It links bank choice of the customer to the benefit assortment offered by different types of banks
A44,This article explores the trends identified in a survey of library directors on efforts to document and communicate library contributions to student retention Library deans or directors have little in the way of communication methods for sharing library impact on retention Methods that are used tend to be unidirectional in nature Based on these results this article also presents a framework of stakeholder markets and examples of reciprocal value propositions library leaders could develop around library contributions to retention efforts This in turn can assist with advocacy and the communication of academic library value to university leaders and other higher education stakeholders
A45,Forward looking firms are increasingly viewing markets as malleable and plastic systems that can be influenced Hence they are engaging in market shaping to proactively augment existing business opportunities or to create new ones One of the recurring themes in the emerging market shaping literature is the importance of value propositions Consequently the purpose of this paper is to identify configurations of value proposition characteristics that are effective for focal firms engaging in market shaping strategies In our empirical study we analyze market shaping actions carried out by 21 case firms using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis We identify four characteristics of market shaping value propositions: enhanced resource integration and related support as the core content of market shaping value propositions and collaborative value proposing process systemic and verified value promise and new representations used in communication as the design characteristics of market shaping value propositions Further we show that even though value propositions can shape markets without displaying all four of these characteristics none of these characteristics alone can create all the expected outcomes Hence we identify distinct configurations of value proposition characteristics that are successful in either changing the elements comprising the market system or inducing an overall system level market change
A46,The purpose of this paper is to present a visualisation of the firm’s offering from a service dominant logic S DLogic perspective The case of Rolls Royce is presented as an avenue through which to explore an alternative view of the firm’s value proposition a visualisation informed by S DLogic that could aid organisations in their transition from goods dominant logic G DLogic to S DLogic Through integration of an operations management approach in process mapping and design and simulation with choice modelling in business to business marketing this paper operationalises some of the key aspects of S DLogic most notably focusing on the constructs of value and resources This is explored through a single case; Rolls Royce which provides access to a rich source of internal and customer dataThe study finds that the S DLogic visualisation of the firm’s value proposition in equipment based service consists of its contribution to 11 value creating activities towards value in use The visualisation depicts both the highest possible bundle of benefits for the customer along with the resources and their costs associated with delivering those bundles When brought together these enable the identification of the optimal bundle of value creating activities from both customer and firms’ perspective This paper provides empirical evidence of the difference between a G DLogic and S DLogic view of the firm’s value proposition In doing so extending existing literature on S DLogic by contributing to a methodological and empirical gap Notably it makes abstract concepts of S DLogic concrete providing a pathway for future empirical work and begins the process of systematising a methodology in S DLogic
A47,This paper aims to elucidate what concepts of encroachment in business to consumer markets explain the market share increase of companies with sustainability value propositions It documents the encroachment field analyses the practice of ten companies and proposes and defines the additional concept of transparency encroachment Design/methodology/approach – Semi structured interviews were conducted with representatives of companies with an increase in customers and market share due to their sustainability value proposition These were supplemented with secondary data like documented interviews sustainability reports and reports on market development The interview transcripts and secondary data notes were coded using template analysis Findings – As the literature on encroachment assumes that new value propositions take away market share from incumbents due to advantages for customers it is questionable whether it can explain how value propositions with advantages for society as a whole can encroach markets The results of this study show that the dominant forms of encroachment in the current literature – high end encroachment low end encroachment and business model encroachment – can only partly explain encroachment through sustainability value propositions An additional encroachment form is identified: transparency encroachment Research limitations/implications – This research adds greater clarity to what companies do when they encroach markets with sustainability value propositions Furthermore the pattern of transparency encroachment is discussed to define the common aspects of this concept and to argue why these aspects are needed for encroachment It implies that marketing activities should start from the perception that customers are allies – and not kings – in the development toward higher levels of sustainability Practical implications – The paper offers practical implications insofar as it deconstructs three aspects of transparency encroachment that are enacted by companies Customer awareness unique experience and customer contribution are all needed to enact transparency encroachment It is argued that other companies introducing sustainability value propositions to encroach markets should find their own application of these three aspects to create the potential for successful encroachment Social implications – Because of the focus on sustainability aspects of value propositions this study generates knowledge about the marketing and encroachment of products with a relatively positive impact on society Adoption of the identified concept of transparency encroachment contributes to sustainable development Originality/value – To date there has been very little marketing research that explores the role of sustainability value propositions in the encroachment of markets Nonetheless nowadays customers seem to look beyond their own benefits and are increasingly demanding a new approach that builds upon the sustainability aspects of products This research adds greater clarity to encroachment through sustainability value propositions
A48,Advances in sustainable purchasing put pressure on firms to evaluate and demonstrate the sustainability of their products and services In this paper we coin the term sustainable value proposition develop a process framework for building sustainable value propositions and illustrate its application with two technology intensive offerings By integrating the literature on sustainable marketing and customer value propositions with life cycle assessment methodologies we build a process framework that can be applied to demonstrate and evaluate the economic environmental and social benefits of industrial products and services The framework comprises identification of potential impacts identification of key value creation mechanisms choosing key indicators life cycle modeling and 5 life cycle value demonstration Through two case studies we examine the development of sustainable value propositions in two industry sectors: metallurgical and automotive The results highlight the value provided to customers through the combination of direct economic benefits and derivative benefits of reduced environmental and social impacts Our paper contributes to the growing field of sustainable marketing by offering guidelines on how to integrate sustainability with the marketing and purchasing of technologyintensive offerings In addition we offer guidelines for how to construct sustainable value propositions that resonate with customers
A49,Scholars identify the value proposition as representing the essence of strategy and the firm’s single most important organizing principle However research suggests less than 10 per cent of companies formally develop value propositions The purpose of this paper is to undertake case study research investigating the process by which leading companies develop their value propositions The research identifies that the financial services and telecommunications vertical markets are viewed as the highly sophisticated industry sectors in terms of customer management These industry sectors are selected for investigation The paper develops case studies of two companies’ approaches to developing value propositions in the business to business and business to consumer sectors within these vertical markets This paper contributes to the marketing literature by examining how two large and complex service enterprises have adopted structured processes for developing innovative value proposition within the B2B and B2C sectors The authors argue that innovation in value proposition development represents a substantive opportunity for marketing to reassert its influence in the boardroom This case study research provides guidelines of the processes by which enterprises can successfully develop innovative value propositions This research is considered to be the first case based academic exploration of the formal processes by which large organizations develop value propositions
A50,Value propositions can play a major role for the strategy development and implementation process in B2B markets While being recognized as one of the firms most important organizing principles the VP concept is still poorly understood and executed in many B2B firms and scholarly research provides limited guidance on how to develop and implement VPs in B2B markets This article re assesses the VP in the context of both strategy and implementation It undertakes a review of extant conceptual frameworks and identifies key elements that are overlooked and/or not addressed A new conceptual framework for addressing VP design and development is offered which incorporates five key interrelated phases of implementation that need to be comprehensively addressed This research provides a theoretically sound and practically applicable VP development framework integrating the firms strategic considerations ensuring a fit between its business model and customers needs and reflecting the nature of B2B markets through its dynamic perspective In addressing key implementation issues the article provides firms with a robust approach to addressing the dynamic competitive environment as well as taking into account changing customer needs
A51,Research into the identification and development of value propositions has recently been identified as a key research priority by the Marketing Science Institute The purpose of this article is to identify and develop a process for value proposition deconstruction that can help organizations transform their value propositions in order to gain an improvement in their competitive position A case study of an exemplar organization in the health care sector is used to develop an approach for value proposition deconstruction Using the business system concept as a theoretical framework the key value adding elements that comprise this organization’s value proposition are identified A leading financial services firm is used to demonstrate how this learning approach can be successfully applied in developing a new and innovative value proposition Using the business system framework a structured process for deconstructing value propositions is developed This framework is extended to explicitly acknowledge the value in use that results from different encounters to incorporate learning processes and to recognize its interactive and recursive nature The authors provide practitioners with insight into how to formulate new or improved value propositions This work addresses two important and previously unaddressed research questions: how can the process of deconstruction of an exemplar organization’s value proposition provide a more comprehensive understanding of the elements that comprise a superior value offering; and how can this process be applied to other organizations seeking to improve their value proposition?
A52,The customer value proposition has a critical role in communicating how a company aims to provide value to customers Managers and scholars increasingly use CVP terminology yet the concept remains poorly understood and implemented; relatively little research on this topic has been published considering the vast breadth of investigations of the value concept In response this article offers a comprehensive review of fragmented CVP literature highlighting the lack of a strong theoretical foundation; distinguishes CVPs from related concepts; proposes a conceptual model of the CVP that includes antecedents consequences and moderators together with several research propositions; illustrates the application of the CVP concept to four contrasting companies; and advances a compelling agenda for research
A53,The talent acquisition process involves complex interactions between potential job seekers and the enterprises that seek to ultimately employ them Although both parties are aligned to produce an optimal outcome the emergence of social media technologies and a workforce adept at using them offers new challenges for companies At the same time studies of millennials reveal that they are a large demographic currently seeking employment and that one of their characteristics is a valuesorientation Just as talent managers are recognising the changing attitudes of their potential workforce companies are becoming aware that they need to seek talent proactively rather than relying on traditional job postings Social media strategies provide opportunities for companies to reach out to today’s job seekers by using new types of engagement through direct contact and personalization This paper investigates opportunities and challenges in utilising social media during the recruitment process based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the understand deliver measure cycle We present two case studies with a large and mid sized firm to illustrate how companies can utilise social media to create a value proposition for job seekers and personalise content to enhance talent acquisition
A54,Suppliers in business markets are increasingly providing complex offerings which is reflected in concepts like hybrid offerings servitization and solution business Such complex offerings are characterized by value propositions in which the value that emerges throughout the entire customer usage cycle builds the core element To secure and increase this value in use as perceived by the customers suppliers need to establish activities of value in use management This value in use management comprises monitoring the delivery of the promised value and enhancing customer value in use throughout the entire lifecycle of a complex offering This article investigates which value in use management activities are currently implemented by suppliers how these activities are linked to other business processes and what differences in value in use management activities exist between various types of complex offerings By addressing these questions this research contributes to literature by exploring post deployment processes that affect value in use customer experience when using complex offerings Moreover from a managerial perspective it reveals in which constellations measures of value in use management are currently implemented in practice and therefore are of particular importance Furthermore the results of the study may serve as a starting point to elucidate how measures of value in use management can be implemented successfully
A55,The aim of this article is to explore whether the ecosystem approach is required to understand the new service model of crowdfunding The value proposition approach offers different interpretations for each of the eight levels of value co creation as seen in the service ecosystem A qualitative multiple case study approach is used to analyze the two most representative crowdfunding platforms in Spain Verkami and La´nzanos in terms of the amounts of funds provided This article offers an analysis of specific cases of crowdfunding in the arts and cultural sector through the biggest platforms in Spain The sampling design could be improved by including the experiences of crowdfunding projects in other countries in the analysis The findings could assist service managers and practitioners to improve planning of value cocreation through the value propositions approach with a variety of actors within the service ecosystem This article is a contribution to the development of service dominant logic in relation to FP 7 and FP 10 Managerial contributions include the development of a crowdfunding service ecosystem model for arts managers which offers not only a method of generating finance or economic value but also opportunities for strengthening bonds with customers and other stakeholders This article is unique in that it integrates value proposition categories in micro meso and macrocontexts and analyzes the different kinds of cocreation that exist in the crowdfunding context
A56,The transition toward the sustainability driven circular economy is emerging across global markets The circular economy refers to a regenerative and restorative economic system that aims to optimize resource usage and reduce waste and offers potential to innovate novel value creation opportunities in B2B markets However how the value creation opportunities in circular economy are captured in supplier firms’ customer value propositions remains underexplored To address this critical gap we develop a theoretical framework that illustrates the architecture of CVPs and use it to conduct an extensive multiple case study across several industries offering types and firm sizes analyzing 74 documented CVPs in the Finnish circular economy The results reveal that CVPs in the circular economy embody four alternative value creation logics that are built on different forms of innovations and highlight different design elements This study advances current marketing theory by illustrating how suppliers articulate CVPs in the circular economy and highlighting the key differences to prevailing insights from linear economy For managers this study offers important insights into designing CVPs that resonate with circular economy–oriented customers and broader stakeholders
A57,Managers need to be able to identify and develop their organizations dynamic capabilities for value creation opportunities Although earlier dynamic capabilities literature has highlighted the importance of market creation it has not examined dynamic capabilities and value propositions development process Utilizing a modified steering wheel tool and a longitudinal case of a multinational enterprise MNE in ship building industry we mapped the joint development of dynamic capabilities and value propositions Our analysis revealed the developments to be accumulative and pathdependent With this study we contribute to dynamic capabilities MNE and process research Furthermore we unearth critical events and paths for managers guiding their companies through the service business development process in our everglobalizing world
A58,To perform new technologybased firms NTBFs need to develop value for customers that distinguish them from others in the market Therefore the development of noveltyoriented value propositions are important and may be influenced by several factors We argue that the propensity to become more noveltyoriented can be influenced by an internal drive to grow growth orientation and by external contributions business networks Hence the purpose of this paper is to analyse how business networks and growth orientation effects on the novelty orientation of NTBF value propositions Based on survey data from 401 NTBFs founded between 2013 and 2015 in the nascent startup phase noveltyoriented value propositions of NTBFs positively relate to informal management networks as well as founders attitudes towards growth Thus such networks and attitudes from founders should be supported in the very early phases of startup if novelty orientation is to be preferred as a performance determinant
A59,Abstract Employer branding has drawn the maximum attention of researchers and industry practitioners in recent days Retaining and attracting current and potential employees essentially require the employers to understand the work value preferences of employees which vary across time and culture This paper has twin objectives a to identify the value proposition frameworks for internal and external employer branding from work value preferences of Indian workforce; and b to analyse the effects of demographic variables and their interactional effects on work value preferences of employees Data were collected from 302 Indian employees from different Indian organisations Findings suggested sixfactor model for internal employer branding and fivefactor model for external employer branding Further analyses MANOVA for demographic variables and their interactional effects on work value preferences also revealed significant findings Value proposition framework and their policy implications in Indian context are discussed in detail
A60,Managers often struggle to determine why their firm is underperforming relative to its rivals This article outlines how managers and consultants can use an existing strategy tool Kim and Mauborgnes strategy canvas to robustly test whether their firm is underperforming because it is 1 properly executing the wrong value propositions delivery or 2 failing to properly execute the right customer value propositions delivery Once the issues with the firms value proposition and its delivery activities are correctly diagnosed the strategic value curve analysis tool assists in developing recommendations to improve the firms profitability The article concludes by describing how the authorssuccessfully used the toolto help a consulting client complete a review of its strategy
A61,In a very insightful paper Eggert Ulaga Frow and Payne 2018 provide the historical evolution of customer value from value in exchange to value in use and how this has dramatically changed the nature and scope of customer value propositions In this paper I will further elaborate on who creates value the marketer or the customer or both in a B2B context In particular I will focus on customer value propositions when value is cocreated between the supplier and the customer This paper will conclude that cocreation of value is more prevalent in all B2B markets and almost universally inherent in B2B services Furthermore since most customer value propositions are from the marketers perspective I will discuss new value propositions from the joint perspectives of both the sellers and the buyers
A62,This paper presents an eightfirm study conducted from the servicedominant logic perspective which makes a contribution regarding knowledge of the anatomy of value propositions and service innovation The paper suggests that value propositions are configurations of several different practices and resources The paper finds that ten common practices organized in three main aggregates constitute and fulfill value propositions: ie provision practices representational practices and management and organizational practices Moreover the paper suggests that service innovation can be equated with the creation of new value propositions by means of developing existing or creating new practices andor resources or by means of integrating practices and resources in new ways It identifies four types of service innovation adaptation resourcebased innovation practicebased innovation and combinative innovation and three types of service innovation processes practicebased resourcebased and combinative The key managerial insight provided by the paper is that service innovation must be conducted and value propositions must be evaluated from the perspective of the customers value creation the service that the customer experiences Successful service innovation is not only contingent on having the right resources established methods and practices for integrating these resources into attractive value propositions are also needed
A63,This paper departs from research on Public Service Logic PSL to advance a framework of public service innovation PSI by incorporating the notions of resource integration and value proposition The framework consists of three resource integration processes referred to as value creation value cocreation and value facilitation through which users and employees detect problems and suggest solutions that contribute to service innovation by creating new or by developing existing value propositions To test and illustrate the framework a study of six service innovation groups in primary care was drawn on Four aggregates of service innovation ideas were identified in the study: access patient experience physical environment and organization of work In line with the framework the findings suggest that users and employees contribute to PSI by drawing on their knowledge and experience of conducting resource integration and by detecting problems and suggesting solutions to these problems
A64,This article contributes to the emerging discipline of service science through an empirical investigation of value propositions as connections between service systems The starting point for our research is that service science is an interdisciplinary approach to the study design and implementation of service systems a service system being considered a dynamic configuration of resources people technology organisations and shared information that create and deliver value between the provider and the customer through service IfM and IBM 2008 Specifically this article investigates value propositions in the context of equipmentbased service systems Our qualitative findings identify three value proposition cycles: Recovery Availability and Outcome In so doing showing that providers offer three distinct propositions of value with three different primary transformations This research contributes to theory in service systems by identifying value propositions as multiple simultaneous and iterative connections between provider and customer systems
A65,The purpose of this paper is to advance a model for identifying the superior customer value proposition that evolves through a process of corporate transformation while simultaneously seeking to align this value proposition with regional expansion and growth of Caribbean financial firms DesignmethodologyapproachThe study utilizes a crosssectional design Telephone surveys were used to collect data from 80 financial firms and 243 customers across ten Caribbean countries Structural equations modeling was employed for data analysis FindingsThe main findings are that corporate transformation of financial firms was a significant driver of customer orientation consumer confidence quality flexibility branding and firm capability while lower prices such as interest rates fees and charges consumer confidence and branding were the key drivers of regional expansion and growth Practical implicationsThe study identified six valueadded dimensions along with price as the superior customer value proposition of financial firms These dimensions should be incorporated in the business model for transformation and growth of these firms OriginalityvalueThe study extended the literature through development of a customer value proposition model that was primarily built on Levitts 1965 product life cycle conceptualization and augmented by Porters generic strategies
A66,Based on the resourcebased view and servicedominant logic this paper tries to examine how the process of offering productcentric or knowledgecentric services can integrate heterogeneous resources so as to create customer perceived value In productcentric service supply the tangible product itself is central to the provision of an integrated set of services while in knowledgecentric service supply intangible knowledge is central to the provision of an integrated set of services The effects of the two dimensions on customer perceived value are quite different This paper examines the specific conditions under which these effects arise by highlighting the important role of customer involvement as a way of mobilizing resources between the supplier and the customer It adopts a large sample survey in the Chinese fine chemical industry The results show that the two kinds of service supply can yield shortterm economic value and technical value to buyers Longterm relational value however can only be achieved through the mediating role of shortterm value and only if customers can acquire knowledgecentric services In addition the effect of knowledgecentric service supply on technical value is stronger if the customer has a greater rather than lower extent of involvement
A67,In this qualitative study the authors apply Callons sociology of translation to examine how new technology entrepreneurs enact material arguments that involve the first two moments of translationproblematization defining a market problem and interessement defining a market and the firms relationship to itwhich in turn are represented in a claim the value proposition That emergent claim can then be represented and further changed during pitches If accepted it can then lead to the second two moments of translation: enrollment and mobilization Drawing on written materials observations and interviews we trace how these value propositions were iterated along three paths to better problematize and interesse articulating a problem and market on which a business could plausibly be built We conclude by discussing implications for understanding value propositions in entrepreneurship and more broadly using the sociology of translation to analyze emergent material consequential arguments
A68,Brand value propositions are receiving increased research attention However two key approaches to supporting the brand value propositioncertification and authenticationhave had minimal academic study We respond to this research need by defining the key concepts of certification and authentication and examining their effects in the context of branding An agenda for future research is proposed and implications for practice are suggested
A69,There is a keen interest in marketing to move away from the neoclassical market definition suggesting that markets are places where demand and supply meet to reach equilibrium In the present study markets are defined as configurations of interdependent elements market actors mental models market actors business models market practices that make an increased density of resources capabilities and value cocreation possible for the participating actors The findings of the research indicate that firms can actively alter market configurations by engaging in market scripting: offering market propositions that illustrate their view on how the market should be configured and engaging actors in activities aimed at creating a shared market view In market scripting the scripting actor aims to align the mental models and business models of other market actors so that they reinforce the mental and business models of the scripting actor and increase the ‘marketness of the market configuration
A70,Business to Business and broader marketing are increasingly influenced by the digital transformation of businessleading to the evolution of new central marketing concepts egvalue propositionsvalue co creationcustomer experiences journeys customer centricityetc Thereforeit is not surprising that important emerging marketing conceptssuch as value propositions remain ill defined We argue herein for the evolutionexpansion of the theoretical boundaries of value propositions from largely a firm centric communication marketing tool toward a concept representing a significant step in an actor's judgment & decision making processes A framework emphasizing marketing interactions is developed that reconciles much of the emerging evidence related to goal theoryperceived valueresource sharingvalue propositions and their communicationmarketing ecosystemsand the value co creation process In the proposed frameworkvalue propositions are re conceptualized as a central within subject belief about resource sharing vis à vis marketing interactions within the larger process of value co creation over time The managerial and research implications of the proposed framework are presented and discussed
A71,"Innovations in business models involve a dynamic process that makes business values resilient against market
and technology changes We propose a schema that supports predicting the effect of innovation on business
model values The schema redefines the value proposition logic in business model innovations with five primary
variables: business dependence structure, business value dominance innovation dynamics innovation domains
and innovation resources agility Based on the schema we have tested a set of hypotheses for 474 cases of
business model innovations in four textile processing technology markets We have estimated and modeled the
data using two techniques Cox modeling and temporal qualitative comparative analysis The former predicts the
business model that is destructed by innovation over time and the latter assesses the configurative conditions for
innovation during the destruction period The findings offer insights for predicting business model innovation as
a value creation platform and for predicting innovative business models in industrial technology markets"
A72,"Central to the value co creation business model is mutualistic interaction through which business value producers
propose offers and affirm the final meaning of offering values with customer experience The model treats
each upstream offering of value production merely as a part of value proposition
Thus the interaction becomes a locus key source of value co creation Contemporary literature on interactive
marketing and service research contain a myriad of theories clarifying the relevance and prominence of the
interaction However there are still limited discussions regarding how business actors may propose a new potential
value and how the actors can judge the validity of the value co creation in multi actor business environments
This study provides a literature review on two main judgment paradigms used as a means to validate
new value proposition and co-creation The two paradigms are as follows collaborative rationality that
evaluates rationales behind business actors interactions for value co creation social heuristics that concerns
group based satisficing decisions and judgments on a specific value proposition Social heuristics use social
information that does not necessarily stem from a formal accurate analysis To corroborate the theoretical
implications of the two paradigms the study analyzes a set of field case value validation processes for a novel
product life cycle management information platform The case study findings illustrate implications for collaborative
business modeling and verification on new service dominant value creation Finally the case study
presents a prescriptive framework for smarter multi actor value propositions and co-creation procedures"
A73,"In todays global supply chains third party logistics providers can play an
important role in implementing the principle of form postponement This
proposes that activities creating product variety and the associated production
mix decisions are deferred along a product family manufacturing and distribution
process as long as possible While both form postponement and third party logistics have
increasingly drawn the attention of the academic community over the last few
years less research has been carried out on form postponement supported by third party logistics providers The present
paper empirically investigates how third party logistics providers can deliver value to companies offering
product variety by providing form postponement services defined as the carrying out of
variety creating activities on behalf of these companies close to the target
markets Our findings indicate that through an form postponement service a third party logistics providers can give its
customers two different kinds of benefits either improved performance in serving
the customers existing markets or entry into new geographical markets Further
our results show that through the choice of the organisational solution for form postponement
service provision the third party logistics providers can increase form postponement value by mitigating a number of
disadvantages that the customer might incur in the case of in-house implementation
of form postponement Challenges that the 3PL needs to overcome to actually provide these
potential benefits are also identified The paper concludes by discussing the
implications of our findings for both practice and research on form postponement"
A74,"The value proposition concept while forming a central foundational premise of service dominant logic
has nevertheless been treated somewhat ambiguously. Recent work in attempting to address this has focused
through a service dominant logic lens on the reciprocal nature of value propositions Important to this work has been a
focus on communicative interactions and resource integration between network suppliers and customers
Overall value proposition thinking has not studied in detail their adoption and use in practice Considering
the compelling notion of reciprocity there have been recent calls for research to consider reciprocal value
propositions in practice. The overall aim of this paper therefore was to explore how reciprocal value propositions
are developed or not in practice at the network level The study was set in the mobile television
sector which as an internet driven sector is viewed as particularly pertinent To conduct the study
an service dominant logic and Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group framework are integrated for the first
time A key finding is that while the reciprocal value proposition concept is theoretically intuitive it is by
no means inevitable in practice Reciprocal value propositions were found to be simultaneously constrained
and potentially enabled by these constraints in practice At an overall level this paper contributes to the
ongoing collaborative process which aims to move service dominant logic from a framework to a theory More specifically
we provide new insights into the development of reciprocal value propositions in practice"
A75,"This mixed method scoping review mapped the emergence of the term People Analytics the value propositions
offered by vendors of People Analytics tools and services and the People Analytics skillsets being sought by professionals Analysis
of academic research and online search traffic since 2002 revealed changes in the relative trajectory of People Analytics and
conceptually related terms over the past fifteen years indicating both the re branding of similar innovations and
a differentiation of priorities and communities of practice The market in commercial People Analytics tools and services is
diverse offering numerous functional and strategic benefits although published evidence of these outcomes
remains sparse Companies marketing People Analytics systems and services emphasise benefits to employers more than to
personnel. Across the sources examined, including specialised online courses People Analytics was largely aligned with HRM,
however its development reflects the shifting focus of HR departments from supporting functional to strategic
organisational requirements Consideration of ethical issues was largely absent"
A76,"value proposition was frequently being used by executives in cable business news interviews
seemingly in lieu of the terms product service or offering
especially in conjunction with digital technology Rather it
was becoming evident that it was about value creation it was accomplished through service for service exchange
and the integration of resources It followed that since value
could not be delivered firms could only propose value thus we
adopted the term value proposition This reasoning originally led to eight
foundational premises which formed the foundation for Evolving
to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing and what later became known as service-dominant logic Thus value proposition was initially treated as a projection or representation of value that could be cocreated
if the customer engaged in service exchange with the firm"
A77,"This paper aims to provide an overview of the European Journal of Marketings special
section on the Forum of Markets and Marketing Extending Service Dominant Logic
The approach takes the form of a conceptual integration of core concepts in SD logic markets and marketing This special section provides 
insight into the complexity of markets by investigating
markets as configurations and systems and how value propositions drive value co creation This introduction to the special section integrates individual
contributions toward advancing Service Dominant logic and suggests that additional research in this area will help
to develop a general theory of markets and marketing The overview of this special section provides insight into how the
development of a positive theory of the market will help to further advance normative marketing
theories and practice This overview of the special section integrates multiple perspectives on
complex dynamic systems and discusses their contributions to the development of an Service Dominant logic based
theory of the market"
A78,"Despite their promise for tackling environmental problems sustainable technologies are difficult
to move from niche to mass markets They require firms to develop innovative business models
This article focuses on how firms can develop their value propositions to increase the market
attractiveness of sustainable technologies that are economically attractive but are difficult to
commercialize The results are based on an analysis of six German utilities that developed
offers for power supply self sufficiency using photovoltaic technology The article proposes four
generic tactics firms can use to market this technology simplify mimic configure and engage
and describes and discusses how each of these tactics can help firms deliver and capture value.
The study also compares and contrasts how firms combine tactics to increase the attractiveness
of their value propositions The article contributes to the growing literature on business models

A80,"A corporation that employs an outside in startup program needs to screen a large
number of potential startups and assess each time What is the value of the startups
offering to our business and what resources and support will the startup need so
we can actually obtain its offering However many startups are not very good at
communicating their customer value proposition in a way that helps the customer
firm making such assessments This article recommends that startups construct
two sequential value propositions The Innovative Offering Value Proposition
communicates how the startups offering creates superior value for the customer
It answers the question What is extraordinary about the startups offering that will
enable the customer to solve a significant problem it has or achieve a top priority it
has The Leveraging Assistance Value Proposition conveys what the customer firm
will get in return for providing support and resources to the startup It answers the
question What will make it worthwhile from the customers perspective to support
the startup to realize its innovative offering"
A81,"New technology based firms aim to create commercially successful products and services based on new 
technology For example a startup company may be founded to commercialize a particular technology developed 
by a university One of the key challenges is to identify which products and services are valuable for customers 
However the relevant knowledge is typically dispersed across the technology firm and potential customers 
This study explores how in this context interorganizational management accounting may support companies 
to collaborate and integrate knowledge First drawing on business marketing literature a customer value 
proposition is conceptualized as a form of interorganizational management accounting Second several case 
studies demonstrate how calculations of customer value were made by new technology based firms and they 
show that these firms had implemented particular offering changes that were informed by specific insights obtained 
from their calculations of customer value Third the study offers a theoretical lens for understanding the 
potential role of customer value propositions as integrating devices for managing knowledge across boundaries"
A82,Many larger technology incumbent companies involve smaller high tech entrepreneurial firms in their innovation processes by outsourcing the development of new products services and processes These R&D firms face the challenge of profitable technology commercialization In this context we study the use of customer value propositions and agreements based on these The problem is that it is not clear how such propositions can be structured under considerable uncertainty Real options logic seems to lend itself in principle to structuring value propositions However recent studies have discussed the organizational challenges of applying real options Hence we specifically investigate under what conditions real options logic can be an adequate base for the development of the value proposition of a small high tech entrepreneurial supplier cooperating with a large scale incumbent firm to develop new technology We provide empirical support based on two case studies Ideas for future research conclude this paper
A83,"The sharing economy as an emerging field is characterized by unsettled debates about its shared purpose and defining
characteristics of the organizations within this field. This study draws on neo-institutional theory to explore how sharing
organizations position themselves such debates with regard to the values these organizations publicly promote
to present themselves as good sharing organizations and the business model features they make visible to appear as
having the right organizational model This study examines the online self representations of 62 prototypical sharing
organizations in Germany with regard to value propositions and business model features. A semantic network analysis of
the features reveals two distinct categories of sharing organizations grassroots initiatives and platform based organizations
By showing how value propositions and business model features are linked in the sharing economy the findings indicate the
different legitimation strategies of grassroots initiatives and platform-based organizations, which we term sustainability by
model and sustainability by feature These findings broaden our understanding of the strategies that organizations apply
to cope with societal expectations in the emerging sharing economy"
